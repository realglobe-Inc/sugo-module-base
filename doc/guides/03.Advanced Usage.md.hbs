Advanced Usage
---------

### Description with `$spec`

You can describe a module with `$spec` property.
The spec object must conform to [module_spec.json][spec_schema_url], a JSON-Schema.

```javascript
{{{read 'example/example-usage-spec.js'}}}
```


[spec_schema_url]: https://github.com/realglobe-Inc/sg-schemas/blob/master/lib/module_spec.json


### Define Custom Class

You can define you own class by extending `Module` class

```javascript
{{{read 'example/example-custom-class.js'}}}
```

### Use Mixins

Sometimes you need to share functions between classes.

[Javascript Class Mix-In](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Mix-ins) would do this.


```javascript
{{{read 'example/example-mixed-class.js'}}}
```

### Modularize Existing Class

Want to use an existing class? You can use `modularize()` method to define a new module class from existing class.
Since SUGO-Actor not supports callback base function, you may need some hack.


```javascript
{{{read 'example/example-modularize.js'}}}
```
